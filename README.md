**ABOUT THE APP**

This application is a simple chat with which we can add our friends by their id and write with them in real time. In addition, it also has mechanics such as setting the user's status and changing the profile picture.

**HOW TO INSTALL**

After downloading all the files in the backend and frontend folders, you will find all the information about the modules that need to be installed and how to run the application on your local computer.

*************************************************************

**WHAT WAS THE PURPOSE OF THE APPLICATION**

I created this application because I wanted to learn how to use tools such as socket.io and React.js, in addition to repeating the ones I already know, such as node.js or mongoDB
